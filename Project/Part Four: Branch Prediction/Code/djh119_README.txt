	This is an early submission, I will try to see if I'm able to fix the problem with the extended late submission. If I can fix the problem then I will resubmit, otherwise I won't. I've drawn out this program countless times, on paper this should be easy. I know the error lies with the 2-bit counter.
	At the start is spits out nasty 2-Bit values, which causes a spike in miss predictions as a whole. 
	I know the transition is used to help keep track of the counter, but it was a problem with keeping control of the counter. 

	Problems: High MisPrediction 	Due: Wrong 2-Bit's 

	Other than this problem, Most numbers are barley off. Also, I think I added "#include <array.h>" to try and get array functions, just a heads up.  

	
	**Also, I was able to run submit_test with my .tgz file
